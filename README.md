Step 3: Data Preprocessing
Prepare the dataset for modeling by handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and scaling features.

Step 4: Train-Test Split
Divide the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the model accurately.

Step 5: Model Training
Train a logistic regression model using the training data.

Step 6: Model Evaluation
Evaluate the model using accuracy metrics and generate a confusion matrix.
